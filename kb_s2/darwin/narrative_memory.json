  "How to open the Notes app on a Mac using Terminal?": "The task to open the Notes app was not successfully executed. The main issue encountered was the failure to open Launchpad and subsequently the Notes app through direct clicking and hotkeys. Here are some potential suggestions to avoid this failure:\n\n1. **Verify Accessibility Permissions**: Ensure that all necessary accessibility permissions are granted to allow the agent to control the computer effectively.\n\n2. **Ensure Correct Execution of Click Actions**: Double-check that click actions are being executed correctly, especially when interacting with the Dock or Launchpad.\n\n3. **Use Alternative Methods Consistently**: If one method fails (e.g., clicking), consistently use alternative methods like Spotlight Search to achieve the task.\n\n4. **Confirm Hotkey Functionality**: Verify that the hotkeys used (e.g., \"fn + F4\" for Launchpad, \"command + space\" for Spotlight) are correctly mapped and functional on the system.\n\n5. **Monitor System Responses**: Continuously monitor the system's response to actions to ensure that each step is executed as planned and adjust promptly if deviations occur.",
  "How to open Notepad on a Mac?": "The task to open Notepad was not successfully executed. The agent mistakenly attempted to open \"TextEdit\" instead of Notepad, which is not available on macOS. Here are the reasons for failure and potential suggestions:\n\n### Reasons for Failure:\n1. **Incorrect Application**: The agent attempted to open \"TextEdit\" instead of Notepad, which is not available on macOS.\n2. **Verification Issues**: The agent did not verify if the correct application was selected or visible in the search results before pressing `Enter`.\n\n### Suggestions:\n1. **Correct Application Name**: Ensure the correct application name is used for the operating system. For macOS, use \"TextEdit\" instead of \"Notepad\".\n2. **Verification of Search Results**: After typing the application name in Spotlight Search, verify that the correct application is selected before pressing `Enter`.\n3. **Direct Application Launch**: Use the `open` method with the correct application name to directly open the application if the search method fails.",

  "How to open Visual Studio Code on macOS using Terminal?": "The task to open Visual Studio Code was not successfully executed. The failure occurred because the agent did not confirm that \"Visual Studio Code\" was selected in the Spotlight Search before pressing `Enter`. The Spotlight Search interface was not visible in the screenshots, leading to assumptions about its state.\n\nSuggestions to avoid this failure:\n1. After opening Spotlight Search, ensure that the interface is visible and confirm that the search bar is active before typing the application name.\n2. After typing \"Visual Studio Code,\" verify that the application is highlighted or selected in the search results before pressing `Enter`.\n3. Use additional navigation keys (e.g., `down` arrow) to ensure the correct application is selected if multiple results appear.\n4. Implement a verification step to check the visibility of the Spotlight Search interface and the selection status of the application before executing the final action to open it."
