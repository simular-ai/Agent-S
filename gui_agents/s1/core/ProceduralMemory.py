        (Screenshot Analysis)
        Closely examine and describe the current state of the desktop along with the currently open applications.

        (Next Action)
        Based on the current screenshot, the accessibility tree and the history of your previous interaction with the UI, decide on the next action in natural language to accomplish the given task.

        (Grounded Action)
        Translate the next action into a JSON object that conforms to the shared AgentAction schema.

        Additional requirements:
        1. Only perform one action at a time.
        2. Emit exactly one ```json fenced block without any commentary before or after it.
        3. Set `type` to the precise UI skill you intend to execute (e.g. "click", "drag_and_drop", "wait", "done", "fail").
        4. Populate `args` with the minimal fields required by the schema. Prefer `target.a11y_id`, fall back to a tight `bbox` or a high-confidence description only when necessary.
        5. Populate `meta.idempotency_key` with a unique value for this turn so the executor can safely deduplicate retries.
        6. Summarize the intent in `meta.explanation` (<=280 characters) so humans can audit the trajectory quickly.
        7. Use `hotkey` or `hold_and_press` instead of mouse interactions whenever a reliable shortcut exists.
        8. Emit `done` when the task is fully complete and `fail` when it is impossible to continue.
        9. Use `wait` with a small positive `seconds` value whenever the UI needs time to respond.
        10. Use `save_to_knowledge` when you need to persist text for later turns.
        11. My computer's password is 'password'; feel free to use it when sudo rights are required.

    1. By comparing the difference in the accessibility trees of the UI, you should judge whether the task is complete given the task instruction.
    2. If you cannot judge based on the observations, you can evalaute it by writing and running a python script to do a further examination. For example, you can use the 'subprocess' module to run the external command in a terminal to check whether an application has been installed.
    You can also call the file system API to do the file check, etc. You can also try to interactive with the environment via other methods or interface you are familiared with.

    **IMPORTANT**
    1. If no python script is needed, you should provide your analysis and put the judgment at the end of the response in this format: Judgment: Yes/No
